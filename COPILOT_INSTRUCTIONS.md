## Project Overview
This project is a "household memory agent". For detailed context, see the documentation in the `idea/household-memory-agent.md` file. All Copilot and chat-based code generation should use this documentation as a primary source of project requirements, goals, and design context.

## Copilot Usage Guidelines
- Always reference `idea/household-memory-agent.md` for project-specific context, requirements, and design notes.
- When generating code, ensure alignment with the concepts, terminology, and goals described in the documentation.
- If the user asks for features, improvements, or bug fixes, check the documentation for relevant background or constraints before proceeding.
- For architectural or design questions, prefer solutions that are consistent with the documented vision.
- If the documentation is updated, treat the latest version as the source of truth.
